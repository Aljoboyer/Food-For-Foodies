                <h2 >My Recipies</h2>

                <p class="third-pa">A recipe communicates the ingredients and procedures the chef uses to make his creations. It is this tool which allows the chef to train and replicate his skill to his staff..We have a-lots of food recipe.Some of below there</p>

                        <h3 class="spanclass">Spaghetti</h3>
                        <p>The most popular way to cook spaghetti is simple. Put the pasta into plenty of boiling water, stir it, bring it to a simmer, turn the heat off, put a lid on and leave it to finish cooking for 10-12 mins. This method works perfectly fine.</p>

                        <h3 class="spanclass">Soup</h3>
                        <p>The formula: broth (chicken, beef, veg - depends on your protein) + salsa (jar, can, fresh) + protein (chicken, steak, meatballs, beans) + rice (cooked or raw) + other veg + seasoning + garnish. It's great because you pretty much always have some version of these things in your fridge, pantry or freeze</p>

                        <h3 class="spanclass">Steak</h3>
                        <p>Physically tenderize the meat.
                            Use a marinade.
                            Don't forget the salt.
                            Let it come up to room temperature.
                            Cook it low-and-slow.
                            Hit the right internal temperature.
                            Rest your meat.
                            Slice against the grain.Undercooked steaks fail to melt the fat in the beef and are quite chewy.</p>
